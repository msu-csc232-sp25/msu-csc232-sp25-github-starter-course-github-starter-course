# What I Learned

## Cloning a Repository
### By reading the README, I was able to find useful links to assist me through my first time cloning a repository. 
### In terminal, the command to create a clone is: git clone followed by the repository URL

## Creating a Branch
### The first step after cloning the repository is to create a branch and checkout the branch to work on it. 
### In terminal, the command to simultaneously create a new branch and check it out is: git checkout -b followed by the new branch name. 

## Comitting Changes
### The next step after cloning a repository and creating a branch is to commit (save) any  changes made. This is a two step process: 

#### 1. Stage the changes.
#### 2. Commit the changes.

### In terminal, the command to stage the changes is: git add followed by the filename.
### To check if the file is ready for commit, use git status. 
### To commit, use git commit -m "..." to commit with a comment. 

## Push Changes
### After committing changes, the branch can be pushed back to GitHub. 
### In terminal use the command git push origin branchName
